### Hi! I'm Chani Maybruch. :wave: As a Data Scientist, I can't wait to help your company achieve its goals!

I have always been fascinated by data analysis and machine learning. Throughout my 15+ years working as an social-organizational psychologist and trainer, I have collected data through interviews, focus groups and surveys. The survey data I collected for my doctrate was used by two other psychology grad students to obtain their doctorates at other universities as well!

Motivated to advance my technical data skills, I pursued a 9-month Data Science boot camp by TripleTen (formerly Practicum USA), graduating in June 2023. During my journey, I coded projects to address real business issues such as customer churn, forecasting profit and risk, text classification, time series forecasting, price prediction, and image classification. I am proficient in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, Excel and always looking to expand my skillset. A quick learner, I enjoy the challenge of learning new technolgies, analyzing complex datasets, and explaining the story behind data.
