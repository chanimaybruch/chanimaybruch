### Hi! I'm Chani Maybruch. :wave: I'm a Data Scientist interested in helping your company achieve its goals!

I have always been fascinated by data analysis and machine learning. Throughout my 15+ years working as an educator and social-organizational psychologist, I have found that the best decisions are research-based and data-driven. 

Motivated to advance my technical skills, I pursued a 9-month Data Science boot camp by Practicum, graduating in June 2023. During my journey, I coded projects to address real business issues such as customer churn, forecasting profit and risk, text analysis, time series analysis, computer vision.

Python, scipy, matplotlib, SQL, nlp, scikit-learn, and plotly.
