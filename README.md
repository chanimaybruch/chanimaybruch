### 👋 Hi there, I’m Chani.

A lifelong people-listener and story-seeker, I’ve spent over two decades as a social psychologist and trainer, helping individuals and organizations thrive by deeply understanding what drives human behavior. Through interviews, focus groups, and surveys, I’ve developed a knack for uncovering meaningful insights and translating them into opportunities for change.

When AI captured my curiosity, I leaned in, earning a data science certification from a rigorous 9-month bootcamp in 2023. Along the way, I dove into Python, SQL, machine learning, and data analysis, building end-to-end projects that tackled real-world challenges like customer churn, profit forecasting, text classification, and image recognition.

Now, I’m excited to bring my unique blend of qualitative depth and analytical precision to roles in UX research, qualitative research, or product management—especially in the AI and LLM space, where human-centered design is more vital than ever.

🛠 Tools of the trade: Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel 
📊 Passion projects: Building dynamic dashboards and exploring rich datasets in my spare time
