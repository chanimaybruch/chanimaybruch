### Hi! I'm Chani Maybruch. :wave: As a Data Scientist I can't wait to help your company achieve its goals!

I have always been fascinated by data analysis and machine learning. Throughout my 15+ years working as an educator and social-organizational psychologist, I have found that the best decisions are research-based and data-driven. 

Motivated to advance my technical skills, I pursued a 9-month Data Science boot camp by Practicum, graduating in June 2023. During my journey, I coded projects to address real business issues such as customer churn, forecasting profit and risk, text classification, time series forecasting, price prediction, and image classification. My skills include Python, NumPy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, SQL, nlp, scikit-learn, and plotly.
